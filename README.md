# Practical Deep Learning for Coders (fast.ai courses)

These are the lecture materials from [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/). Two important parts of the course are  [our online forums](http://forums.fast.ai/) and [our wiki](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Main_Page).  

# Purpose of forking
I want to experiment with the course notebooks and maintain my own copy where I can log my observations by experimenting with the networks trained.

Also, the original notebooks are designed with Keras v1.1.2. I'm intending to replace such stuff and make them compatible with Keras v2 and make TensorFlow as the default backend (by removing Theano default configs).
